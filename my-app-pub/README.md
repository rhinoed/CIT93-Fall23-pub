# App: Peer Review 

###### Name of App: 
Snooze Fest

Helps make a decision to wake up or snooze more.

###### Summary
I struggled a bit with picking a decision for my app. And soon after I started to code it, I wished I had picked something else. I found it hard to motivate myself to work on it, and I did not have a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve with the app. And while it works I am not 100% satisfied with it. 

Schedule Class
```js
// This is something I added in the final step. Some things like the days property are not used yet  
export class Schedule{
    constructor(name="Work", startTime="06:00",days=[1,2,3,4,5],id=SCHEDULES.length, date=""){
        this.name = name
        this.startTime = startTime 
        this.days = days
        this.id = id
        this.date = date

    
    }
   
}

```
